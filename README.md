> Feedback cycles can be wonderful things: rarely do we get the space to reflect on and bask in the accomplishments of our team members. But they are also likely to fill us with dread: feedback cycles are time consuming, they involve heavy process, and since the business doesn’t stop moving during this time, they amount to an additional workload that we often avoid addressing until right before the deadlines. —Jill Wetzler, [“Writing Better Performance Assessments”](https://www.jillwetzler.com/blog/2019/3/17/performance-assessments), 2019

## Why are performance reviews important?
- Check-in with previous goals
- Create new, important-to-you goals
- Practice continuous learning/growth
- See evidence of your improvement
- Help the people you work with succeed

## What should I do when my manager delivers my review?

[Receiving a review means being vulnerable with someone who holds power over you.](https://leaddev.com/management/how-make-performance-reviews-more-productive)

Lead with curiosity. Take what you want and leave what you don’t. 

Your downward review is your boss’s interpretation of your work, but it’s not the whole story of this point in your career. That’s what your self-review (and peer reviews, if your process has those) help round out.

[Performance reviews should be unsurprising, fair, and motivating.](https://larahogan.me/blog/performance-reviews-should-be-unsurprising-fair-and-motivating/)

Your manager *should* deliver your written review to you before you have a conversation about it. Take some time to sit with it, [noting how you feel with some guiding questions](https://leaddev.com/management/how-make-performance-reviews-more-productive). If your review contains pieces that are hard to take in, Paloma Medina has [a week-long process for untangling the difficult feelings that arise from scary/frustrating/triggering feedback](https://www.palomamedina.com/blog/2023/10/31/when-feedback-is-hard). 

Your manager wants you fully understand any growth areas they’ve noted for you and it’s *their* job to foster this environment and conversation! For insight into how they may approach this, read [how Lara Hogan sets up feedback for success](https://larahogan.me/blog/set-future-performance-reviews-up-for-success/).

## How do I write a 360/peer review effectively?

[Good feedback is specific, actionable, and helps the other person grow.](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/)

- Be specific; use tangible examples of their successes
- Trust that they want to grow; be [unfailingly kind](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/be-unfailingly-kind) (not “nice”) 
- Avoid mentionining one-offs (unless the example was egregious)
- Check your biases (like [gender bias](https://psmag.com/economics/men-are-judged-based-on-their-potential-women-are-judged-based-on-their-past-performance))

To give critical feedback, follow the [Feedback Equation](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/):
- **Observation**: A fact about behavior, not a judgment
- **Impact**: How the behavior affects your work
- **Request**: A question or request to adjust behavior

## Why does writing my self-review make me nervous?

Review season is stressful, even if the process is light. 

It’s a lot of mental overhead. Going over six months to a year of work is overwhelming. It’s hard to remember everything. And talking about yourself is emotionally taxing.

If reflection is not a regular part of your life, it can be scary to be forced to reckon with your performance over a long chunk of time.

Being evaluated is almost-always stress-inducing, including assessing yourself.

## What about promotions and raises?

**Your self-review does not determine your promotion or raise.**

Your self-review is a tool to help you and your manager understand your perspective on your work (including identifying gaps in your manager’s assessment of you).

Your manager already has their mind made up about promotions or salary adjustments for this review period. You can’t write your way into changing the last 6–12 months. If you’ve been working with your manager toward a promotion, your self-review may be included in a promotion packet during the Calibration process. Even so, your self-review is not the only artifact, nor the primary artifact, that determines a promotion.

**You can’t write a self-review so good it gets you promoted.** You can’t write a self-review so bad it gets you fired. 
This terrified me at first, but it quickly became the biggest weight off my shoulders. Hopefully it unlocks something for you, too. 

## What is my self-review actually for?

- Reflecting on your accomplishments
- Identifying your areas of improvement
- Planning for the next 6 months

There’s still value in the self-review when you remove the possibility of a promotion/raise. That value is why you’re encouraged by every therapist and self-help book and career coach to [journal your thoughts and feelings](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucianapaulise/2023/08/14/the-power-of-journaling-and-why-it-matters-in-your-career/).

Review season is an invitation to set aside time at work to do **short-form journaling and planning** about work! It’s an opportunity to reflect and goal-set for this job, but it’s also an opportunity to **consider this point in your career**. Put on your favorite study-along/work-along playlist and embrace the journaling session.

### What about the things I’m not great at?

> Focusing on growth areas will help you navigate your career with intent vs. happenstance. Ask yourself: “Where do I want to go and how will I get there?” — Smruti Patel, “[Navigating engineering performance reviews](https://leaddev.com/hiring/navigating-engineering-performance-reviews)”, 2021

Try to let go of the idea that “areas for improvement” are “things you’re bad at”. When you consider where you want to be in your career, your “growth areas” are shifted **from deficits to actual focus areas**.

And if that doesn’t resonate, it’s okay to not want to be better at job-stuff. Late-stage capitalism means we all gotta work. Staying aspirational keeps _me_ sane in the system. But, by all means, fake that section if it’s better for you.

## What other philosophies can I adopt to take the pressure off writing my self-review?

Remember that your self-review is not a persuasive essay.

Focus on progress. This is especially important if you’re caught up in disappointment about projects that didn’t ship or were rolled back. **Your review should show you are always moving forward, even with setbacks.** Your idealistic self-review is a glowing synopsis of accomplishments, but life and work don’t always go that way. You can still tell the story of your progress and growth.

## What other tactics can I use to take the pressure off writing my self-review?

Instead of long sentences/paragraphs, try **formatting with Markdown headings and bullet points**. Keeping the format light can help you focus on the content. (Secondarily, if you’re driven by empathy, remember your manager has to read a few of these, so they’ll appreciate the brevity, too!)

**Trade your draft with a colleague** before you submit it in the HR system. The (positive) social pressure of promising to swap edits with a coworker will help you avoid procrastinating. We’re often our own biggest critics, so your colleague can help you identify areas where you’re not giving yourself enough credit.
