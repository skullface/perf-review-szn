## Why are performance reviews important?
- Check-in with previous goals
- Create new, important-to-you goals
- Practice continuous learning/growth
- See evidence of your improvement
- Help the people you work with succeed

## What should I do when my manager delivers my review?

[Receiving a review means being vulnerable with someone who holds power over you.](https://leaddev.com/management/how-make-performance-reviews-more-productive)

Lead with curiosity. Take what you want and leave what you don‚Äôt. 

Your downward review is your boss‚Äôs interpretation of your work, but it‚Äôs not the whole story of this point in your career. That‚Äôs what your self-review (and peer reviews, if your process has those) help round out.

[Performance reviews should be unsurprising, fair, and motivating.](https://larahogan.me/blog/performance-reviews-should-be-unsurprising-fair-and-motivating/)

Your manager *should* deliver your written review to you before you have a conversation about it. Take some time to sit with it, [noting how you feel with some guiding questions](https://leaddev.com/management/how-make-performance-reviews-more-productive). If your review contains pieces that are hard to take in, Paloma Medina has [a week-long process for untangling the difficult feelings that arise from scary/frustrating/triggering feedback](https://www.palomamedina.com/blog/2023/10/31/when-feedback-is-hard). 

Your manager wants you fully understand any growth areas they‚Äôve noted for you and it‚Äôs *their* job to foster this environment and conversation! For insight into how they may approach this, read [how Lara Hogan sets up feedback for success](https://larahogan.me/blog/set-future-performance-reviews-up-for-success/).

## How do I write a 360/peer review effectively?

[Good feedback is specific, actionable, and helps the other person grow.](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/)

- Be specific; use tangible examples of their successes
- Trust that they want to grow; be [unfailingly kind](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/be-unfailingly-kind) (not ‚Äúnice‚Äù) 
- Avoid mentionining one-offs (unless the example was egregious)
- Check your biases (like [gender bias](https://psmag.com/economics/men-are-judged-based-on-their-potential-women-are-judged-based-on-their-past-performance))

To give critical feedback, follow the [Feedback Equation](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/):
- **Observation**: A fact about behavior, not a judgment.
- **Impact**: How the behavior affects your work.
- **Request**: A question or request to adjust behavior.
